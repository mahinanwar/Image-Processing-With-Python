# Image-Processing-With-Python
Image processing has been used to create weird and beautiful modifications to pictures many of us have seen online. Older black and white photos can be brought to life using colorization techniques. On the other hand, color photos can be made to look like old black and white photos. In addition to distorting images for entertainment, image processing can be used for more serious applications, for example, to enhance medical imaging to screen patients for cancer or other diseases.

In this program, I will create a Python application that reads from a list of images, modifies their size and appearance, and saves the images in another directory.
